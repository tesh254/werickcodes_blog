You building an application with React and Node. You write your React code in ES6 but when you visit your Node backend code you happen to write in ES5. I found this quite annoying due to the change and also the `require` method. If you feel you are comfortable writing ES5 Node, you can skip this blog but if you might like making your frontend and backend switch quite seamless as we wait to figure out **deno**, you are in luck, because I will guide you in all the steps you will have to undertake and I have an existing **NodeJS ES6 template setup** already on Github.

# Prerequisites

* Basic knowledge of writing JS in ES6 standard
* Basic expressjs concepts

# Let's get started

The usual stuff, create a new folder to house our code and change directory to the folder.

```bash
$ mkdir node_api_es6_template && cd $_
```

Create a `package.json` file to track our dependencies

```bash
$ yarn init -y
// or
$ npm init -y
```
Use whichever command, you feel comfortable with but throughout this project I will use **yarn**, I always feel its like **npm** but on **steroids**.

We will have to install a couple of babel packages to transpile our ES6 code to ES5

```bash
$ yarn add babel-core babel-eslint babel-plugin-transform-runtime babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-stage-1 babel-register
```

We will create a `.babelrc` file that holds certain babel configurations. These configurations instruct babel to transpile to a specific ECMAScript standard.

```bash
$ touch .babelrc
```

Let's add some JSON inside the file, stating all configs.

```json
{
    "presets": [
        "es2015",
        "stage-1"
    ],
    "plugins": [
        "transform-runtime"
    ]
}
```

We will have to edit the `package.json` file, especially the `script` key(defines a set of node scripts you can run). 

```json
{
  "name": "nodejs_blockchain_app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "src",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "./node_modules/.bin/mocha --require @babel/register",
    "start": "node .",
    "dev": "nodemon -i \"*.test.js\" .",
  },
  "author": "wachira",
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {
    "babel-core": "^6.26.3",
    "babel-eslint": "^10.0.3",
    "babel-plugin-transform-runtime": "^6.23.0",
    "babel-preset-es2015": "^6.24.1",
    "babel-preset-stage-1": "^6.24.1",
    "babel-register": "^6.26.0",
  }
}
```

* The `test` command will enable one to run tests written in ES6 standard
* `start` will enable one to be able to run the server in production mode
* `dev` will enable one to run the server in development mode using `nodemon` CLI tool.

We will install a couple of packages to have a whole node/express server running perfectly.

```bash
$ yarn add express body-parser chalk
```

* `express` is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It will enable us to spin up a web server faster.
* `body-parser` is a Node.js body parsing middleware. When you decide to work on a full CRUD API, this will come in handy.
* `chalk` helps with colorful Nodejs logs

# Let's get coding

We will create an `src` folder to house all of our Node API code.

```bash
$ mkdir src
```

Inside we will create two files one to house our server code and the other to transpile our ES6 code.

```bash
touch app.js && touch index.js
```

Open `src/app.js` file with your favorite editor and let's add some code

```javascript
"use strict";

import express from "express";
import bodyParser from "body-parser";
import cors from "cors";
import dotenv from "dotenv";
import chalk from "chalk";

const app = express();

// Configure Dotenv to read environment variables from .env file
// automatically
dotenv.config();

// Define json body reader
app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

app.use(express.static(__dirname, { dotfiles: "allow" }));

// Enable proxy x-Forwadded-*
app.enable("trust proxy");

// Enables CORS
app.use(cors());

// Set port
app.set("port", process.env.PORT || 5000);

// Initialize server
app.listen(app.get("port"), err => {
  if (err) {
    console.log(chalk.red(err.message));
  } else {
    console.log(chalk.green(`Server is running on port ${app.get('port')}`));
  }
});
```

Next, open the `src/index.js` and add two lines of code

```javascript
// Imports the babel library to transpile our code
require("babel-core/register")

// Import our server code
exports = module.exports = require("./app")
```

After you have added your code, let's spin up our **express** server

```bash
$ yarn dev
// or
$ yarn start
```
You should see a green log on your console

else you should receive a red log on your console with a descriptive error message.

That's it
