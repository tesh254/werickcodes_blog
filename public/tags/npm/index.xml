      <description>Introduction I have always had a deep interest in writing Desktop applications. What was holding me off throughout the years was, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t interested in learning C++ or Java to make them. I wanted to build Desktop apps with Javascript, so I landed on Electron, a Javascript Desktop application framework, developed and maintained by Github.
Electron is such a big deal that it will allow you to create Desktop apps for all the major OS with a single codebase.</description>
