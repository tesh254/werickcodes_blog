      <description>Introduction I have always had a deep interest in writing Desktop applications. What was holding me off throughout the years was, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t interested in learning C++ or Java to make them.

Electron is such a big deal that it will allow you to create Desktop apps for all the major OS with a single codebase.</description>

      <description>Next.JS is a javascript framework that allows developers to create server-rendered react web apps also comes with other perks that make frontend development swift.

So why am I redoing my blog from scratch? Before I could launch an MVP of the blog, I had to work on the SEO and also make it easier for web crawlers, which in turn helps with a great search engine score and indexing.</description>
