      <description>I had an idea of building a public API, sort of similar to the Marvel API, where you get to fetch all Marvel characters.
When I was brainstorming on how I would build the API, I thought about three key things: * It should be public and everyone should access (take note) * An admin account to allow me to update the API&amp;rsquo;s content.
The problem with making it public as it would be quite risky especially when someone runs a bot that results in DDoS attack happens and well the API will be free and I will be paying for the server costs.</description>
