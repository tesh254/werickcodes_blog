      <description>I just started learning to Golang recently, and I must say the Golang is not that difficult. To fully grasp the syntax as a web developer I opted to create an API.
In this blog, we are going to create an Authentication API with the help of the gin web framework and use a MongoDB database with the help of mgo.v2
This blog will be a two-part series covering all authentication endpoints: * The first part focuses on basic Signup and Login of a user.</description>

      <description>Introduction This is the second part of the series for Docker meets NodeJS where we are going to introduce a database service, MongoDB, which we will connect to it with our Node app through a network.
 Note: Since we are introducing a new database service, by doing so this also makes our Node app also a service
Note: Ensure you go through the first part of this series since it contains a huge part of how we created our Node app within a Docker container.</description>
